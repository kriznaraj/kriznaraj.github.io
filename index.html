            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm a Senior Lead Software Engineer at <strong>Chargebee</strong> with 12+ years of experience spanning
                full-stack product development, distributed systems, and GenAI-based platform architecture. I build
                resilient infrastructure, intuitive developer tools, and intelligent systems that drive outcomes for
                global SaaS platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work blends architectural depth with hands-on execution‚Äîfrom frontend frameworks and backend
                orchestration to observability, multi-region scaling, and AI-first platforms. I‚Äôve led major initiatives
                like ERP integration frameworks, async job engines, and LLM-powered assistants.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Chargebee, I architected and own <strong>Chargebee Copilot</strong>, an AI-native assistant that
                automates billing and support workflows. It integrates <strong>OpenAI</strong>,
                <strong>Anthropic</strong>, <strong>LangGraph</strong>, <strong>LangChain</strong>,
                <strong>Pinecone</strong>, and <strong>Langfuse</strong> to deliver contextual, agent-driven RAG
                pipelines. The result: <strong>30% reduction in ticket inflow</strong> and <strong>50% faster first
                    response times</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also led the architecture for our <strong>ERP & CRM Integration Platform</strong>, reducing
                development effort by <strong>80%</strong> and enabling 10+ connector rollouts (including
                <strong>NetSuite</strong>, <strong>QuickBooks</strong>, <strong>ZohoCRM</strong>, and
                <strong>HubSpot</strong>). I bring deep domain expertise in <strong>Accounts Receivables and billing
                    automation</strong>, especially within NetSuite ecosystems.
            </p>

            <p>
                I operate at the intersection of platform engineering, AI product thinking, and developer
                experience‚Äîtaking 0‚Üí1 ownership of complex systems with clarity, empathy, and execution rigor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of Chargebee, I co-founded <strong><a href="https://revmonk.io" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">Revmonk</a></strong>‚Äîa real-time lead intelligence tool that enriched high-intent
                web traffic and triggered auto-personalized outreach for marketing teams. I owned the entire stack
                (tracking, enrichment, orchestration, campaigns). We onboarded 50+ trial users and 2 paying customers
                before sunsetting due to operational costs‚Äîsharpening my product instincts and founder mindset.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also contribute as a <strong>mentor within my company</strong>, a <strong>volunteer with CEG alumni
                    network</strong>, and a <strong>tech advisor to early-stage startups</strong> in my network. I‚Äôm
                part of the <strong>API Review Council</strong> and <strong>engineering hiring committee</strong> at
                Chargebee.
